This is a React project from [gemoraphy's](https://www.gemography.com/) bootcamp.

I use [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), a dev build tool, which in turns uses Rollup as a bundler, since `create-react-app` was taking forever to start and couldn't be configured without ejecting.

Start development by installing deps `yarn` and spinning up the dev server `yarn dev`.

To build for production, run `yarn build`.
